# pH-Detection-with-LCD
This project uses a pH detection sensor to measure the pH level of a solution and display the result on an LCD. The pH value is also represented by an RGB LED: red for acidic, green for neutral, and blue for basic. The system outputs real-time pH readings and voltage on the serial monitor for further analysis.

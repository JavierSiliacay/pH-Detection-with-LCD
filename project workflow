Workflow for pH Detection Sensor with RGB LED

Sensor Setup

Connect the pH sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.

Attach the RGB LED to digital pins D2, D3, and D4 for red, green, and blue channels, respectively.

Wire the LCD with I2C interface to the SDA and SCL pins on the Arduino.

Arduino Initialization

Initialize the serial communication for debugging.

Set up the RGB LED pins as output.

Initialize the LCD and display a welcome message.

Sensor Reading

Continuously read the analog value from the pH sensor.

Convert the sensor value to a corresponding voltage.

Calculate the pH value based on the voltage using a formula.

pH Range Classification

Check the pH value:

If pH is less than 6.8, classify it as acidic and set the RGB LED to red.

If pH is between 6.8 and 7.9, classify it as neutral and set the RGB LED to green.

If pH is greater than 7.9, classify it as basic and set the RGB LED to blue.

Display on LCD

Display the pH value on the LCD screen in real-time.

Update the message with the pH condition (acidic, neutral, or basic).

Loop

Repeat the reading, calculation, classification, and display process every second.

Power and Reset

Ensure that the system operates continuously and resets as needed based on any hardware or software resets.
